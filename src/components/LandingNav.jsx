        <h1>Welcome To our Leaf Ninja Academy</h1>
        <p>
          The Academy is quite large and is comprised of several buildings which
          were erected over time. The building can be identified by the tree in
          front of it which has a swing on it and more so, by the giant sign
          with the kanji for "fire" (ÁÅ´) on it. Classrooms in the Academy are
          large and have high ceilings, based on a theory that larger classrooms
          lead to expansive education, expanding even to the blackboard itself.
          In front of the blackboard is a podium, situated far from the
          students' desks and put in a position where the teacher can view
          everyone at once.
