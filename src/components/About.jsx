          Ninja in a hidden village have their own skill levels which help
          delineate what rank they are. The most talented ninja in the village
          is generally the Kage who leads the village, the lowest tier is made
          up of those young individuals training in the ninja academy. Listed
          below is the ranking from lowest skill level to highest. Groups such
          as the ANBU are not a level, but rather a specialized unit made up of
          ninja from the Chuunin and Jounin levels.
